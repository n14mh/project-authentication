<p>Dear Craig,</p>
<p>I hope this message finds you well. Iâ€™m writing to confirm if the Q2 budget allocations for the IT infrastructure upgrade have been finalised. We are currently reviewing supplier quotes and would appreciate clarification on the funding before proceeding.</p>
<p>Looking forward to your response.</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>Head of Marketing</p>
